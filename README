NAME
RT-Extension-ShowRelations

DESCRIPTION
  If you work a lot with ticket links, it is hard to keep an overview
  of all tickets and related ticket status. Normally you have to open
  each ticket to see the status/owner, with this RT-Extension you can
  see all your tickets (from a search) with their related tickets

INSTALLATION

1. you get what you pay for
2. it's free

The consequences are that I won't guarantee the correctness of this document,
