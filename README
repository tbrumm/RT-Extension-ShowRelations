NAME
	RT::Extension::ShowRelations

DESCRIPTION
	If you work a lot with ticket links, it is hard to keep an overview
	of all tickets and related ticket status. Normally you have to open
	each ticket to see the status/owner, with this RT-Extension you can
	see all your tickets (from a search) with their related tickets

LICENSE
	Under the same terms as perl itself.
