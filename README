NAME
  RTx::ShowRelations

DESCRIPTION
  If you work a lot with ticket links, it is hard to keep an overview
  of all tickets and related ticket status. Normally you have to open
  each ticket to see the status/owner, with this RT-Extension you can
  see all your tickets (from a search) with their related tickets

  Attention: This is outdated and will not work under RT4+. A new 
  Version will be ready soon.

INSTALLATION
  1. Run "perl Makefile.PL"

  2. Run "make"

  3. Run "make install" (you may need root permissions)

  4. Additionally, if you're running 3.8, you'll need to add
     "RTx::ShowRelations" to @Plugins in
     etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm.  For example:
     Set(@Plugins, qw(RTx::ShowRelations));

  6. Clear RT's mason cache and restart the web server to make sure the
     extension is incorporated.
   
LICENSE
